### Aim
Performed a correlational study to see whether our hippocampus was responsible or played a role in managing our spatial memory.

### Procedure
50 Non-Taxi Drivers and 16 Taxi - Drivers from London.

The time that the taxi - drivers had been doing their job was recorded (this happened to give them an age gap of 32-62 years).

Each participant had their brain scanned using the MRI technique.

### Results
The posterior part of the hippocampus in the taxi-driver's was far larger than those of the hippocampi in the non-taxi driver's.

The general size of the hippocampus was also increased as well.

### Conclusion
The hippocampus has been linked to the way in which humans are able to remember where they have been and directions, this is known as 'Spatial Memory'.

### Strenghts
It offers us good knowledge about the 'Localisation of Function' in the brain, and how spatial memory could be linked to our hippocampus.

MRI scans were also used, which does very little damage to patients and is still extremely accurate most of the time.

### Weaknesses
The experiment was not very generalisable as only right - handed males were used, as well as only taxi -drivers from London. This means that other places and females are discounted.

It is only a correlational - study so we are unable to determine a clear cause and effect relationship between the size of the hippocampus
