# Atri et al (2004)

### Aim
Determine/test the role of acetylcholine in memory formation

### Procedure
28 english speakers from a university

=== "Phase 1"

  ```
  - Participants read 18 related pairs and 18 unrelated pairs of words (overlapping and nonoverlapping pairs of words used)
  - Given one word and asked to give its pair
  - Between recall, participants perform distractor tasks
  ```
  
=== "Phase 2"
  ```
  - Allocate participants to one of 3 conditions. No injection, glycopyrrolate injected or scopolamine injected
  - Same procedure as phase 1
  ```

### Results
In all 3 conditions,overlapping pairs scored lower and scopolamine did the worst (weren't able to recall any overlapping pairs).

### Strenghts
Results can be replicated with quantitative data

### Weaknesses
Not ecologically valid since it was done under extremely controlled conditions
