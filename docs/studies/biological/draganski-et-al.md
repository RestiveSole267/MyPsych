# Draganski et al (2004)

### Aim
Find out whether the human brain can change structure in response to enviromental demands.

### Procedure
Random sampling design, self-selected sample.
Randomly allocated a sample of volunteers into two groups:
- Group 1: Jugglers
- Group 2: Non-jugglers

Made sure that both groups had no experience of juggling before the start of the experiment. Performed three MRI. The First MRI was performed, the participants of the juggler group subsequently spent three months learning a classic juggling routine with three balls. The Second MRI was performed, participants in the juggler group spent three months where they were instructed not to practice juggling. Third MRI was performed.

### Results
Prior to the start of the experiment there was no difference in brain structure, the second scan the jugglers had more gray matter in areas of the cortex mostly the mid-temporal area. Third scan differences decreased but, jugglers denser gray matter.

### Conclusion
If we practice something then our brain will increase and we stop practicing then it will decrease again, but often not its original state.

## Strengths
No researcher bias - random sampling, Replicable, and establishes a cause/effect relationship.

## Weaknesses
Low ecological vaildity, and Participant bias - self-selected
