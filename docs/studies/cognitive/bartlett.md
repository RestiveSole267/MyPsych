# Bartlett (1932)

### Aim
Bartlett wanted to investigate how information changes with each reproduction and to find out why the information changes.

### Procedure
He deliberately chose 'The War of the Ghosts', a North American Indian folk tale from another culture and unknown to the participants.

### Results
The first participant read the story twice themselves (serial reproduction) then after 1530 mins told the story to a second participant. Each participant repeated their story to the next person in a chain of participants. 

### Conclusion
For the repeated reproduction task each participant was tested separately after reading the story to themselves twice, 15 minutes later they gave their reproduction of it. Later reproductions were done at 20 hours, 8 days, 6 months and 10 years for different participants. Participants did not know the aim of the study.

### Strengths
Both the repeated and serial reproduction tasks were done many times to show that the changes to the story followed the same patterns.
Other stories were also used and showed similar results.

### Weaknesses
By choosing unfamiliar material, Bartlett could not be sure that the changes he found would happen with familiar information.
Bartlett did not always test the repeated reproduction participants after the same time intervals, so the changes over time cannot be compared fairly.
