Procedure Random sampling design, self-selected sample. Randomly allocated a sample of volunteers into two groups: - Group 1: Jugglers - Group 2: Non-jugglers Made sure that both groups had no experience of juggling before the start of the experiment. Performed three MRI. The First MRI was performed, the participants of the juggler group subsequently spent three months learning a classic juggling routine with three balls. The Second MRI was performed, participants in the juggler group spent three months where they were instructed not to practice juggling. Third MRI was performed. Results Prior to the start of the experiment there was no difference in brain structure, the second scan the jugglers had more gray matter in areas of the cortex mostly the mid-temporal area. Third scan differences decreased but, jugglers denser gray matter. Conclusion If we practice something then our brain will increase and we stop practicing then it will decrease again, but often not its original state. Strengths No researcher bias - random sampling, Replicable, and establishes a cause/effect relationship.

Procedure 50 Non-Taxi Drivers and 16 Taxi - Drivers from London. The time that the taxi - drivers had been doing their job was recorded (this happened to give them an age gap of 32-62 years). Each participant had their brain scanned using the MRI technique. Results The posterior part of the hippocampus in the taxi-driver's was far larger than those of the hippocampi in the non-taxi driver's. The general size of the hippocampus was also increased as well. Conclusion The hippocampus has been linked to the way in which humans are able to remember where they have been and directions, this is known as 'Spatial Memory'. Strenghts It offers us good knowledge about the 'Localisation of Function' in the brain, and how spatial memory could be linked to our hippocampus. MRI scans were also used, which does very little damage to patients and is still extremely accurate most of the time. Weaknesses The experiment was not very generalisable as only right - handed males were used, as well as only taxi -drivers from London. This means that other places and females are discounted. It is only a correlational - study so we are unable to determine a clear cause and effect relationship between the size of the hippocampus","title":"Maguire (2000)"},{"location":"studies/biological/maguire/#maguire-2000","text":"","title":"Maguire (2000)"},{"location":"studies/biological/maguire/#aim","text":"Performed a correlational study to see whether our hippocampus was responsible or played a role in managing our spatial memory.","title":"Aim"},{"location":"studies/biological/maguire/#procedure","text":"50 Non-Taxi Drivers and 16 Taxi - Drivers from London.
